-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. canteen_criteria_avg
-- One row per canteen with the average of each of the 5 criteria
-- plus the average dish rating,
-- plus how many ratings that average is based on. This is the
-- ONLY table the TOPSIS engine reads from — it never touches raw
-- criteria_ratings directly, so the algorithm stays fast even as
-- the ratings table grows.
--
-- Also includes average menu price per canteen (from menu_items)
-- as an alternate/cross-check for the "price" criterion, since
-- price can be judged both by student ratings AND actual menu cost.

-- Feedback joined with like/dislike counts, ready for the

-- happens in the application layer using these counts).
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. dish_ratings_by_canteen
-- For a given dish name, shows how it's rated at each canteen
-- that sells it, along with its price. This is what powers
-- "which canteen has the best Vada Pav" — a simple filter on
-- item_name against this view, sorted by avg_rating desc.
-- Also computes a rating-per-rupee "value_score" for a
-- "best value" sort option.

-- 5. canteen_crowd_by_hour
-- Check-ins bucketed by canteen and hour-of-day (0–23), so the
-- app can answer "when is this canteen usually less crowded."
-- Pure aggregation — no ML involved.

-- 6. canteen_criteria_bayesian(min_ratings)
-- Bayesian-adjusted ("shrinkage") averages — the fix for sampling
-- bias where some canteens have far fewer ratings than others
-- (e.g. IMDR being under-sampled in the original field survey).
--
-- Formula: weighted_rating = (v/(v+m)) * R + (m/(v+m)) * C
--   R = canteen's own average for that criterion
--   v = number of ratings that canteen has
--   m = minimum-ratings threshold (how many ratings you'd want
--       before fully trusting a canteen's own average)
--   C = global average for that criterion, across ALL canteens
--
-- A canteen with few ratings gets pulled toward the global average
-- (its small sample isn't fully trusted yet). As ratings accumulate
-- (v grows), the formula trusts that canteen's own number more.
-- This is the same technique IMDb uses for its "weighted rating."
--
-- Passed as a function (not a plain view) so min_ratings (m) is
-- adjustable, e.g. SELECT * FROM canteen_criteria_bayesian(10);
